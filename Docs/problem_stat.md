# Problem Statement
Coastal areas play a huge role in our lives — they support fishing communities, protect us with mangroves, and store massive amounts of blue carbon. But these regions are under constant threat from rising sea levels, cyclones, erosion, pollution, and even illegal dumping. The problem is that most current systems to monitor and warn about these threats are scattered, slow, or don’t reach the people who actually need the information, like fisherfolk or local disaster teams. What’s missing is one unified platform that brings data from sensors, satellites, and past records together, uses AI to spot early signs of trouble, and then pushes quick alerts to both authorities and coastal communities so they can act before it’s too late.
