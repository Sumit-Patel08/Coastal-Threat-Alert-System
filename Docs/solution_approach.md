## üîé Solution Approach  

Our project aims to build a **Coastal Early Warning & Awareness System** using AI/ML, IoT, and satellite data to protect coastal communities and ecosystems.  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Integration  
- Collect data from multiple sources:  
  - **Physical sensors** (tide gauges, buoys, weather stations)  
  - **Satellite feeds & open APIs** (NOAA, INCOIS, NASA, Google Earth Engine)  
  - **Historical records** of sea levels, cyclones, algal blooms  
- Build a **data ingestion pipeline** to clean, process, and stream real-time inputs  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ AI/ML & Analytics  
- Use **AI models (or APIs)** to detect:  
  - Unusual sea-level rise  
  - Cyclone patterns  
  - Algal bloom signatures  
  - Pollution/illegal dumping anomalies  
- Provide **forecasting & risk scoring** (severity levels, probability of events)  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Early Warning & Alerts  
- Generate actionable alerts for different user groups:  
  - **Authorities & NGOs** ‚Üí detailed dashboards + reports  
  - **Fisherfolk & communities** ‚Üí simple SMS, push notifications, multi-language support  
- Disseminate alerts via **multiple channels** (SMS, app, WhatsApp API, radio, govt. systems)  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Awareness & Community Support  
- Each alert includes **awareness tips** (safety instructions, preparation steps)  
- Dashboards display **educational content** on coastal safety, sustainable fishing, and climate resilience  
- AI chatbot answers **common awareness questions** (e.g., _‚ÄúWhat to do before a cyclone?‚Äù_)  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ User Feedback & Continuous Learning  
- Collect **community feedback** on alerts  
- AI improves accuracy using **local data + traditional knowledge**  
- Feedback loop ensures **relevance & trust** in the system  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Scalability & Future Enhancements  
- Expand with **IoT sensors, drones, and blockchain** for secure monitoring  
- Support **regional and national deployments** across coastal areas  
- Create a **resilient, community-first platform** for long-term coastal sustainability
