## Phase 1 (MVP)
**Goal:** Show a working proof of concept.  
- Collect mock data or open APIs (NOAA, INCOIS, NASA).  
- Implement simple anomaly detection (rule-based or AI API).  
- Build a basic dashboard (map + live data visualization).  
- Trigger alerts via SMS (MSG91 free version) & push notifications (Firebase free).  
- Add short awareness messages with alerts (e.g., “Avoid fishing today, waves are rough”, “Keep emergency kits ready”).
- Display safety tips and emergency contacts on the dashboard.
- Provide multi-language awareness popups for fisherfolk & communities.
- **Demo Scenario:** “Sea level spikes → system detects → sends alert + shows awareness tip (‘Stay inland until safe’).”

## Phase 2 – Functional Prototype
**Goal:** Expand features and prove feasibility.  
- Integrate real-time data APIs (ocean, weather, satellite).  
- Add AI-based forecasting (tides, cyclones, pollution anomalies).  
- Multi-user roles:  
- Authorities → detailed dashboards.  
- Fisherfolk → SMS/app alerts in simple terms.
- Add “Did you know?” tips on dashboards (e.g., How to prepare before a cyclone).
- Fisherfolk alerts include short safety tips (not just “danger”).  
- Dashboard improvements: historical trends, risk heatmaps, severity levels.  
- Enable local language alerting for communities.


## Phase 3 – Pilot Deployment
**Goal:** Test in a real coastal community.  
- Partner with NGOs or local governments.  
- Add satellite image analysis (Google Earth Engine for algal blooms, erosion).  
- Deploy mobile app with offline support for fisherfolk.  
- Awareness workshops & training in pilot communities (partner NGOs can help).
- Collect community knowledge (local signs of storms) into the system.
- Community feedback loop → system learns from real usage.  
- Improve AI accuracy with local datasets.


## Phase 4 – Scalable Solution
**Goal:** Regional and national adoption.  
- Integrate IoT sensor networks (tide gauges, buoys, weather stations).  
- Add drone-based monitoring for illegal dumping & erosion.  
- Blockchain-backed tamper-proof logging of environmental data.  
- AI chatbot assistant: “What is the tide risk in my area today?”  
- Alerts via multiple channels: SMS, app, WhatsApp API, radio, govt. systems.
- National-scale awareness campaigns integrated into the app (push notifications, seasonal safety checklists).
- AI chatbot also answers awareness queries (e.g., What is red tide?).  
- Scale across coastal states.
